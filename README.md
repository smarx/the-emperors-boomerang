# Boomerang test environment

The Emperor's Boomerang is an NFT puzzle on Ethereum.

This project should help you figure out a working solution locally before trying it on mainnet.

To get started:
```shell
npm install
npx hardhat test
```

Notice that a test is failing. You need to write some code in `Thief.sol` and `test.js` to make that test pass.
